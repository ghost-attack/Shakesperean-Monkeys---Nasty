## A beautiful story about infinity 
A monkey randomly hitting keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will eventually end up writing a Shakespeare play. Not because there is something inherently special about Shakespeare's works, but simply because, at one point, monkey will run out of things to write. Whether 

But Shakespeare is boring and there are much easier ways to express what you are feeling. Simple, concise ways. Sentences that use a fixed number of 8 words, perhaps.

This project puts at your disposal an infinte amount of monkeys to write sentences of the type `She [blank] on my [blank] until I [blank]`. All you will ever need to fully communicate every single thing that passes through your thoughts.

## Monkey methodology
Monkeys roughly know what words should look like, so they will try their best to write something comprehensible for you. For every sentence you want, they will create 3 words between 1 and 20 letters, with random letters. Words are more likely to have a length around 4, 5, 6 letters, but all lenghts in that range are possible. 
After a monkey types the three words for you, they will be combined with the template, and thus a sentence will be formed.

Every time a monkey writes something that actually contains words from the English language, that sentence will be saved to a file. This way, you will only see the sentences that you can truly use to express yourself.

## How to run
Um just open the python file and maybe also get the saved_sentences.txt file and then run the file.
Enter an integer number and the monkeys will generate that amount of sentences. Note: This is the amount of random sentences that the monkeys generate, not the number of English sentences you will get.

## Disclaimer
- The amount of monkeys we provided is actually not infinte and depends solely on how good your computer is. Please don't ask for a trillion sentences.
- Most of the sentences will contain very short words. Single letters are also considered words, plus the chances of finding and actual word get smaller and smaller the more letters you add. However, eventually (with an infinite amount of time) you will get a sentence with very fancy complicated words.
- What a monkey considers "comprehensible" may not be comprehensible to you, the close-minded human. Dare to open your soul to the great possibilities of the monkey sentences.
